# Coding Challenge Solutions 🚀

This repository is a collection of my solutions to various algorithmic problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and **Codeforces**. 

The goal is to move beyond just solving problems and instead focus on mastering **Algorithmic Patterns**.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized hierarchically by the strategy used, followed by the difficulty level:

`Pattern Name` -> `Difficulty Level` -> `Problem_Name.ext`

## 🧠 Coding Patterns

### 1. Sliding Window
The Sliding Window pattern is used to perform a required operation on a specific window size of a given array or linked list, such as finding the longest subarray containing all 1s. This pattern reduces the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$.


* **Fixed Window:** The window size `k` is constant (e.g., Maximum Average Subarray).
* **Dynamic Window:** The window size grows or shrinks based on a condition (e.g., Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters).

### 2. Binary Search
Binary Search is a "divide and conquer" algorithm. It is used to find the position of a target value within a **sorted** array. By repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, it achieves a logarithmic time complexity of $O(\log n)$.



* **Standard Search:** Finding a specific element.
* **Search Space:** Applying binary search on a range of possible answers rather than an array index.
